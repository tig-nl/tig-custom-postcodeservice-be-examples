# TIG Postcode service examples

### Information
This repository provides several usage examples of our Postcode BE service that you can implement in your environment immediately. For more information about our Postcodeservice BE please visit https://tig.nl/postcode-service-be/.
The examples in this repository are completely free to use and edit.

The examples provided make use of the TIG Test account. Remember that usage of this account is limited. To make use of our service it is required to have your own Client ID and Secure Code. If you do not have either of those yet feel free to request your own test account by contacting TIG by calling 020-21 81 000 or sending an e-mail to servicedesk@tig.nl.
